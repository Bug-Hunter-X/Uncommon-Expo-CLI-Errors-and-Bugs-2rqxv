This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project.  The exact error message varies, but it typically involves issues with building the project, installing packages, or running the development server.  The root cause often lies in inconsistencies between the project's configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `app.json`, `eas.json`), conflicting dependencies, or problems with the underlying Node.js environment. For example, an error might occur during the build process indicating a missing dependency or a version mismatch.  Or, the development server might fail to start, reporting an error related to port conflicts or internal module issues.
