The solution to these errors depends heavily on the specific error message.  Generally, debugging involves the following steps:

1. **Check the full error message:** Carefully examine the complete error message. It usually provides valuable clues about the source of the problem.
2. **Examine your config files:** Verify the correctness of `package.json`, `app.json`, and `eas.json`.  Look for typos, missing fields, or version mismatches.
3. **Check your dependencies:** Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly and are compatible with each other. Run `expo install` to install or update packages. Resolve any conflicting versions.
4. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes a clean rebuild resolves inconsistencies. Try `expo prebuild`, `expo start --clear` or deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling packages.
5. **Verify Node.js and npm/yarn:** Confirm your Node.js version meets Expo's requirements. Update npm or yarn if necessary.
6. **Check for port conflicts:** The development server might fail to start if a port is already in use. Try changing the port using the `--port` flag or identify and stop the conflicting process.
7. **Examine Expo SDK version:** Ensure that your Expo SDK version is compatible with your other dependencies and the Expo CLI version.
8. **Consult Expo documentation:** Search for the error message in the official Expo documentation for troubleshooting guidance.
9. **Search for similar issues:** Check online forums, Stack Overflow, and the Expo community for solutions to similar problems.
10. **Create a minimal reproducible example:** If you can't find a solution, create a minimal project that reproduces the error and share it with the Expo community for help.
